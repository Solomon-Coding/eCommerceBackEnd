# eCommerceBackEnd

## Description

This project was done in order to create a backend for a eCommerce application. THis project was done so as to better learn sql models and how routes can be used to view, create, and update data from a sql server. Through this project I have gained a much better understanding express node calls, sql, and model calls.
